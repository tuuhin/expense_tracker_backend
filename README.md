### :bookmark_tabs: Back-End
Being a `django ` project , using it's abilities to seperate the content into apps. We have created three apps :

- [x] base
- [x] api
- [x] plans 

#### :briefcase: base 
Base deals with the authentication and authorization stuff,for the authentication we have used `json web tokens` for more information  [jwt]("https://jwt.io) . There is a functionality to create profiles ,with images ,for storing the images `aws-s3` buckets are used. To see the available [routes]("https://github.com/tuuhin/expense_tracker_backend/blob/main/base/urls.py").


#### :flying_saucer: api
Api is related to most of the basic routes to deal with incomes and expenses.With the context of the project this is the main app, which deals with the most important job .Too see the [routes]("https://github.com/tuuhin/expense_tracker_backend/blob/main/api/urls.py")

#### :man_playing_handball: plans
This app is contains all of your planning with the amount of money that you track off. currently the only features available for this app is to add ***goals*** and to create ***budget***

### :anchor: DataBase
For every `backend` app `database` is one of the most important thing. The app is configured for `sqlite` database but other databases like  [postgres]("https://www.postgresql.org/") or [mysql]("https://www.mysql.com/") could be used .To use other database change `DATABASES` under `settings.py` in expense_tracker or `PROJECT_FOLDER` 
- configuration for ***postgress***
```bash
    pip install psycopg2
```
```py
DATABASES = {

    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'HOST': env('HOST'),
        'NAME': env('NAME'),
        'USER': env('USER'),
        'PASSWORD': env('PASSWORD'),
        'PORT': 5432,

    }

}
```
- configuration for ***mysql***
```bash
    pip install mysqlclient
```
```py
DATABASES = {
    'default':{
        'ENGINE':'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME':env("NAME"),
        'USER':env("USER"),
        'PASSWORD':env('PASSWORD'),
        'HOST':env('PORT'),
        'PORT':'3306',   
    }

```
